  The view of the earth from the moon fascinated me - a small disk, 240,000
  mniles away. It was hard to think that that little thing held so many
  problems, so many frustrations. Raging nationalistic interests, famines, wars,
  pestilence don't show from that distance. I'm convinced that some wayward
  stranger in a space-craft, coming from some other part of the heavens, could
  look at earth and never know that it was inhabited at all. But the samw
  wayward stranger would certainly know instinctively that if the earth were
  inhabited, then the destinies of all who lived on it must inevitably be
  interwoven and joined. We are one hunk of ground, water, air, clouds, floating
  around in space. From out there it really is 'one world'.

  Look again at that dot. That's here. That's home. That's us. On it everyone
  you love, everyone you know, everyone you ever heard of, every human being who
  ever was, lived out their lives. The aggregate of our joy and suffering,
  thousands of confident religions, ideologies, and economic doctrines, every
  hunter and forager, every hero and coward, every creator and destroyer of
  civilization, every king and peasant, every young couple in love, every mother
  and father, hopeful child, inventor and explorer, every teacher of morals,
  every corrupt politician, every "superstar," every "supreme leader," every
  saint and sinner in the history of our species lived there--on a mote of dust
  suspended in a sunbeam.

  The Earth is a very small stage in a vast cosmic arena. Think of the rivers of
  blood spilled by all those generals and emperors so that, in glory and
  triumph, they could become the momentary masters of a fraction of a dot. Think
  of the endless cruelties visited by the inhabitants of one corner of this
  pixel on the scarcely distinguishable inhabitants of some other corner, how
  frequent their misunderstandings, how eager they are to kill one another, how
  fervent their hatreds.
</p>

<p>
  Our posturings, our imagined self-importance, the delusion that we have some
  privileged position in the Universe, are challenged by this point of pale
  light. Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark. In
  our obscurity, in all this vastness, there is no hint that help will come from
  elsewhere to save us from ourselves.
</p>

<p>
  The Earth is the only world known so far to harbor life. There is nowhere
  else, at least in the near future, to which our species could migrate. Visit,
  yes. Settle, not yet. Like it or not, for the moment the Earth is where we
  make our stand.

  It has been said that astronomy is a humbling and character-building
  experience. There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human
  conceits than this distant image of our tiny world. To me, it underscores our
  responsibility to deal more kindly with one another, and to preserve and
  cherish the pale blue dot, the only home we've ever known.
